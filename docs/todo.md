## Issues

- Apps won't open terminal when they try to open a file manager (show in folder does not work) (maybe xdg-open doesn't see foot?).
- Steam is a black window on ideapad-laptop.
- Ideapad-laptop wakes immediately when suspended.
- Unclear whether niri lid switch events are actually happening when laptop closes.
